Steps to running the server (whom from now on will be refered to as Anton)
Recommended to download Webstorm, create blank project and then inport the DellHack directory

Also, your first time running the server you will see a lot of errors that say something like:
"Cannot find module ..." when that happens, just run: npm instal nameOfMissingModule
You can get them all at once if you chose by just typing in: npm install

1. Install npm and node

2. Run npm install from the terminal where you will be running your program.

3. run: $ node server.js

4. Open up a web browser and go to http://localhost:8000

5. You should see the webpage on there.

6. Fill out the information and hit login. Then you should see the information you added into the json file.
